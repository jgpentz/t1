Describe why this package was developed and what problem it was intended to solve.

== Installation

*Describe to end users how to install this tool if it requires anything special e.g. not just `pip install x`*

NOTE: Your Python install must be setup according to the instructions on link:http://confluence.firstrf.com/display/GI/Python[confluence] in order to be able to install from FIRST RF's internal pypi server.

== Usage

== Developing

. Git clone `splot_api`

. (Optional) Create your own branch to work on for your new feature:
+
[source,shell-session]
----
> git switch -c new_feature_name
----

. Setup the development virtual environment:
+
[source,shell-session]
----
> pipenv sync --dev
----

. Make your changes. Please write tests for all of your changes if they don't already exist! Please format your code with black (already selected in .vscode directory).

. Run all tests (everything should pass)
+
[source,shell-session]
----
> pytest
----

. Ensure that your code meets all formatting and linting requirements
+
[source,shell-session]
----
> black .
All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
50 files left unchanged.
> flake8 --config=setup.cfg
----

. Update `CHANGELOG.adoc` with a description of your changes. If this project is customer facing, limit yourself to only the relevant public API information which will be shared with the customer.

. If you are not working directly on `main`:
.. Rebase or merge `main` to your branch and re-run all tests to ensure everything still passes.
.. Merge your branch to `main`

. (Optional) Creating a new tag will automatically release the package to the pypi server. Do so using the `bumpversion`.
The commit your tag points to must be incorporated into the default branch for the release pipeline to succeed.
+
[source,bash]
----
> bumpversion minor
> git push
> git push --tags

=== Versioning

This package follows the https://semver.org/[Semantic Versioning 2.0.0] paradigm for version numbering. When you make a change, the version must be incremented for it to be installable from our internal https://pypi.firstrf.com[pypi server]. Given a version number `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, increment the:

- MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes (backwards incompatible)
- MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
- PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes to existing functions


==== Release Candidates

If required, release candidates may be used to indicate a version is pre-release. The included `.bumpversion.cfg`
supports release candidates, but requires a special flow due to limitations with `bumpversion` itself.
An example development flow is illustrated below:

[source,bash]
----
# Assume we are starting at version v0.0.1, and we do a few typical bumps
bumpversion patch
# v0.0.1 -> v0.0.2

bumpversion minor
# v0.0.2 -> v0.1.0

# at this point, development matured and we're almost ready for a 1.0.0 release
# let's do a release candidate first before we release it to the wild
# --new-version is required to switch over to "release candidate mode"
bumpversion major --new-version="1.0.0rc0"
# v0.1.0 --> v1.0.0rc0

# hey! we caught a bug. Let's bump to a new RC candidate
bumpversion pre
# v1.0.0rc0 --> v1.0.0rc1

# one more bug...
bumpversion pre
# v1.0.0rc1 --> v1.0.0rc2

# okay. We're good to go on the official release.
# must use --new-version again to switch back to "normal mode"
bumpversion pre --new-version="1.0.0"
# v1.0.0rc2 --> v1.0.0

# and so on.....
----

==== IMPORTANT
After making changes, please add brief descriptions of your changes at the
top of the CHANGELOG.adoc file. Leave the following flag in place until ready for release.
....
:approved-for-release: no
This flag needs to be switched to
:approved-for-release: yes
....
when ready to release.  This will also allow you to preview the UNRELEASED
section before submitting.  Bumping the version will fail if 'approved-for-release' is no.
A successfull bump will replace a new 'template' section in CHANGELOG.adoc as well as move the 'approved-for-release' flag back to 'no'.


NOTE: Please be mindful of the end audience. If this file is customer facing, only
share information which is relevant to their available API. Each section
should have the layout as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
.Template Section
----

 :approved-for-release: no
 ifeval::["\{approved-for-release}" == "yes"]
 == UNRELEASED
